This project began as a workaround for the advertisements and popups used as part of the imx.to interface.  The server side script harvest the essential information from the desired gallery pages.  The front end allows navigation through alphanumeric neighbor URLs, showing the first thumbnail for each URL and then allowing you to see all the thumbnails for a particular URL, with the option of saving all (server side at the moment) or just accessing the large version of the images one by one as desired.
